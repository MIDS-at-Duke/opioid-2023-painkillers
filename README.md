# README: Analysis of Opioid Prescription Regulations in Florida, Texas, and Washington

## Project Overview
This repository presents an analysis of the effectiveness of opioid prescription regulations in Florida, Texas, and Washington. The study is particularly relevant to government officials and stakeholders concerned with the opioid crisis.

## Study Objectives
- Evaluate the impact of opioid prescription policies in Florida, Texas, and Washington.
- Assess policy effectiveness using mortality rates and incoming opioid shipments as key metrics.

## Methodology
### Analytical Approaches
1. **Pre-Post Analysis**: Comparing data before and after policy implementation in each state.
2. **Difference-in-Difference Analysis**: Isolating the policy impact by selecting control states with similar trends prior to policy implementation.

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Mortality Rate**: Related to opioid use.
- **Incoming Shipment Volume**: Measured in Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) per capita.

## Key Findings
- **Pre-Post Analysis**: Indicated initial success of the policies in all three states.
- **Difference-in-Difference Analysis**: Suggested that the policies in Washington and Texas were not entirely effective.
- **Most Effective Policy**: Florida's approach, including Operation Pill Nation, emerged as the most impactful.

## Implications
While the chosen metrics (mortality rate and MME per capita) provide useful insights, they might not fully encapsulate the entire impact of the policies on opioid usage. However, they serve as significant indicators of the policies' effectiveness.

## Repository Contents
- Data files: Containing pre and post-policy implementation figures for each state.
- Analysis scripts: For conducting both pre-post and difference-in-difference analyses.
- Results documentation: Detailed findings and interpretations from the analyses.

## Conclusion
The analysis contributes valuable insights into the effectiveness of opioid prescription policies, highlighting the relative success of Florida's comprehensive strategy. It emphasizes the need for continued research and policy refinement in addressing the opioid crisis.
